## MEET 2 - GEOSPASIAL DATA ##

**Geospatial data**, GIS data or geodata have explicit geographic positioning information included in them, such as the road network of GIS, or geo-referenced satellite imagery. Geospatial data can include data attributes that describe the features found in the dataset.

On Earth, this one can also find a variety of objects for example, just like the Mountain, Sea, Road, Water Attractions and anything related to spatial. It is a source of Geospatial data in the database.

In Geospasial Data, There are:

**1. Raster**

Raster is a representation of the world as its surface is divided into a regular grid of cells. raster model is useful for storing data that vary continuously, such as in aerial photographs, satellite imagery, surface chemical concentration, or surface elevation.

**2. Vector**

Vector data consists of individual dots, which (for the 2D data) is stored as a pair (x, y) coordinates. Points can be joined in a specific order to create a line, or join a closed ring to make a polygon, but all vector data essentially consists of a list of coordinates defining the knot, together with the rules for determining whether and how to join knot. Vector Model A representation of the world also using points, lines, and polygons. vector model is useful for storing data that has discrete boundaries, such as state border, plot, and roads.
